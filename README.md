This stupid and useless project is a quick overview of the Google Chrome Javascript APIs and of the Google Chrome Extension building process. Feel free to ignore it, because I most certainly will.

Usage
-----

I won't blame you if you want to try! Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable the _"developer mode"_ and load the extension. A new icon is now available near the Omnibox. Click on it to enable the extension and use your imagination to compose your very own filler.
You can now go to https://twitter.com and write a new tweet to see the magic.
